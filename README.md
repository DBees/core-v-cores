CORE-V Family of Open Source RISC-V Cores

Here are the links to the OpenHW Group CORE-V Family of RISC-V cores:

[CV32E40P](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cv32e40p) Originally known as the PULP RI5CY core, the CORE-V CV32 is a 32bit, 4-stage core that implements, RV32IMFCXpulp, has an optional 32-bit FPU supporting the F extension and instruction set extensions for DSP operations, including hardware loops, SIMD extensions, bit manipulation and post-increment instructions.  This repository is has been moved (not forked) from the original PULP Platform github repository to its new home at the OpenHW Group github repository.

[CVA6](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6) Originally known as the PULP Ariane core, the CORE-V CVA6 6-stage, single issue, in-order core implementing RV32GC or RV64GC extensions with three privilege levels M, S, U to fully support a Unix-like (Linux, BSD, etc.) operating system. It has configurable size, separate TLBs, a hardware PTW and branch-prediction (branch target buffer, branch history table and a return address stack).
